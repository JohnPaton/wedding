# John & Lisette's Wedding Site

This is my first proper self-made website. It's just a static page but I think it looks nice and does what it's designed to do.

Features:

* Responsive with Bootstrap
* Nice full-page entry screen
* Sticky-top navbar once it reaches top of page
* Smooth scrolling to navbar selections
* Navbar section highlighting based on scrolling position
* Navbar expand/collapse for mobile
* Mobile navbar collapse + smooth scroll on nav link click
* Fixed images which change as content scrolls over them
* Cute icons & background from Flaticons for consistent look & feel
* Embedded Google map for location
* RSVP form validation requirements dependent on user-selected option (require group size if user is accepting invite, and disable group size & diet preferences if they aren't)
* Ajax form submission to email via Formspree
* Success/error alerts on valid form submission
* Disable all RSVP form inputs on successful submission so user can see what they have submitted but no longer make changes

To do:

* Dutch dutch version to match the English
* Maintain position on page when switching language
