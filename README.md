# John & Lisette's Wedding Site

This is my first proper website made from scratch. It's just a static page but I think it looks nice and does what it's designed to do.

## Features

#### Sexy
* Nice full-page entry screen
* Fixed-background images which change as content scrolls over them
* Cute icons & background from Flaticons for consistent look & feel
* Smooth scrolling to page sections when selected from navbar
* Sticky-top navbar once it reaches top of page
* Navbar section highlighting based on scrolling position


#### Mobile
* Responsive with Bootstrap
* Navbar expand/collapse for mobile
* Mobile navbar collapse + smooth scroll to page section on selection from navbar


#### Useful
* Position on page maintained when switching languages
* Ajax RSVP form submission to email via Formspree
* RSVP form validation requirements dependent on user-selected options (require group size if user is accepting invite, and disable group size & diet preferences if they aren't)
* Success/error alerts on form submissions
* Disable all RSVP form inputs on successful submission so user can see what they have submitted but can no longer make changes


## To do
* Dutch text to match the English page
* ~~Go live on own domain~~
* Fix image display on iOS browsers
